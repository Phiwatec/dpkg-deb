This way, I have manage dependencies, auto update, service ...
I put here the link : https://packages.azlux.fr/

All scripts I use to build the packages are public (see the main page, there are a link).

The systemd service is also automatically set.

The function `dpkg-reconfigure sheepit` is now implemented. You can setup all your config with this tool. You will be prompt for sheepit options.

No need to manually change the systemd service.
